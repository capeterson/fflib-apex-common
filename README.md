=================

__This fork is generally not what you should be looking at - check out the upstream for the official repo.__


I use this fork most often for staging pull requests of work done internally at FinancialForce that needs to be submitted to the main repo. These will generally come from patch files that if I'm in the middle of applying may be broken or otherwise incomplete. 

Clone at your own risk, although the develop branch should generally be in a state that somewhat resembles stable.
